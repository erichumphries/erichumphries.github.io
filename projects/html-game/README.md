# HTML-Adventure-Game---Mystic-Manor
To start the game, I recommed checking out my github.io link at https://erichumphries.github.io/projects.html
In this game, you'll assume the role of a daring soul longing to see what truly lies behind the gates of the mystic manor.
But beware! There are ways to die so be careful with each coice you make.
There are multiple different endings based on what you collected along the way, but there is only one true ending.
This was created as a way to learn HTML and CSS in one of my classes, so it isn't too groundbreaking.
