It also acts as a vessel for sharing views of certain articles. The target audience is for the average person to be able to write an article for the world to see. Measures will need to be taken to prevent such freedom from being abused, like forcing people to have an account to comment or post. By making people have accounts, we can give more options to the user for convenience, such as letting them update their articles, delete their articles, look at the view count and view times of their articles, look through their own comment history, and look at their view history. The website will also be separated into different categories as well as recommend articles to the user based on their view history and what’s been trending (viewed and liked the most). <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the frontend, the user will see recommended articles on their homepage or a general homepage if they aren’t logged in. They’ll see an option to login at the top, as well as quick navigation to various genres of articles. When the user decides on an article, they will be taken to a new page for the article. When they scroll to the bottom of the article, they’ll be able to add a comment if they are logged in. On the backend, this is where the processing of the webpage ids will be as well as the accounts. The webpage hyperlink will be in the form of a unique id at the end that gets passed to the database to see if it exists. The comment section will be organized similarly to reddit where comments can be upvoted or downvoted as well as being organized in that way. The backend will also be in charge of deciding on the recommendation system for comments and articles. The database will store our account information, the articles, and the comments.

A lot of work and learning went into this and I am happy to unveil the final product. For the styling of the website, I used a mix of CSS, bootstrap, and animate. The hardest part was getting used to all the bootstrap commands, but it was nothing they did not have online documentation about! In the future, I would like to go back and make it less simplistic as well as add some cleaner animations.
